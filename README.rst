awa is the maori word for river

some have called awa "a web application"

which is a backronym at best


what it is
==========

awa is a fully-featured, multi-paradigm
django-based web publishing system.

for example, the relatively simple site
at awa-web.com uses this software; however,
the long-term goal is for individuals to
be able to run independent, multi-user
social interaction sites with verified
federated authentication.

in other words, set up your own private
social network at xyz.net, have people
identify themselves using a known system
like facebook or google, but sending none
of the activity data or metadata to those
providers.
